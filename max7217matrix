 Code History:
 --------------
 
 The orginal code was written for the Wiring board by:
 * Nicholas Zambetti and Dave Mellis /Interaction Design Institute Ivrea /Dec 2004
 
 First modification by:
 * Marcus Hannerstig/  K3, malmï¿½ hï¿½gskola /2006
 
 Second modification is by:

  -if you are using more then one max7219, and they all should work the same, 
 then use the function maxAll ---maxAll(register (1-8), collum (0-255))
 -if you are using more than one max7219 and just want to change something
 at one little guy, then use the function maxOne
 ---maxOne(Max you wane controll (1== the first one), register (1-8), 
 collum (0-255)). During initiation, be sure to send every part to every max7219 and then
 upload it. For example, if you have five max7219's, you have to send the scanLimit 5 times
 before you load it-- other wise not every max7219 will get the data. the
 function maxInUse  keeps track of this, just tell it how many max7219 you are
 using.

 *Modified Feb 2012
 *We modified the method of calling the LEDs to binary. It appears to work better this way as the Matrix.h library is no longer a library supported by Arduino.
 -----------------------------------
 
 General notes: 
 *To view pictures of the setup, go to flickr.com/photos/littlegreenfrogbot....
 *To address the matrix in binary you will need the first row of your 'segment' LEDs in the decimal place pin of the max7219 labeled "seg dp". 
 * Make sure to attach the negetive side of your LED matrix to the Digit pins of the chip and the positive side to the Segment pins of the chip.
 *This is how to address LEDS in a binary list. DP, A, B, C and so on refer to pin slot LED is in: maxSingle(1, 0b DP A B C D E F G);
 *In the binary below, 1 = LED is on in that row, 0 = LED is off
